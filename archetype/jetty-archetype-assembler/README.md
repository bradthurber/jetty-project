#Using the archetype

##Create your project
Go to a directory where you'd like to create your project.

Generate from the archetype:
    $ mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.mortbay.jetty.archetype -DarchetypeArtifactId=jetty-archetype-assembler

Follow the prompts and choose your values for groupId, artifactId, version, and base package

It will also ask you for the version of jetty you wish to use.

Your project will be created in a directory named for your artifact id. 

##Running Locally

Go to your project directory.

Build the application:

    $ mvn install

Set the location of your maven repository (usually in your home directory under .m2/repository)  into the REPO variable:

    $ export REPO="/home/user/.m2/repository"

Run the application:

    $ sh target/bin/webapp

Now you can test your application by opening a browser and going to http://localhost:8080
